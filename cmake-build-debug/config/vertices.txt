# formatting should be done as follows:
# write the coordinates of each vertex by typing out the number and setting as comma + space before the next.
# to make it nicer to look at, it is recommended to write the last digit for all numbers in the same row
# no more than 3 coordinates per line, and write individual vertices below each other.
# I recommend naming collections of vertices that resemble and object, and name them the same in the triangles.txt
# this will make identifying which vertices belong to which mesh a lot easier.
# Also each line that isn't a comment will be numbered
# Comments can be made by prefixing a line with a hash symbol
# inline comments are not possible
# Each object should be declared using [cVertices-OBJECT]-ID, where ID is a custom identifier (can be string or numeral)
# while this is not strictly necessary, it will ease working with the editor and deleting objects.
